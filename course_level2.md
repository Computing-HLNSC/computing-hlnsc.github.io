## Course Description

You will also benefit from an hour of tutorial and four hours of functional skills (Literacy and Numeracy) per week; note, if you have achieved grade D at GCSE in either English or Maths, you will be given the opportunity to study for and resit your GCSE in that subject rather than take Functional Skills.
<br>There are 3 Core units that are designed to cover the body of content that employers and educators within the sector consider essential for 14â€“19 year old learners. Two of these core units are externally assessed by the exam board through 1 hour online examinations. Herefordshire & Ludlow College's policies and procedures for exams comply with the exam-board's external assessment process.
<br>The specific aims of the course are to:
 - Provide a comprehensive and challenging programme of study related to IT/computing that is particularly suited to post-16 learners who have the relevant interest and aptitude to progress in the sector
 - Provide a broad and balanced programme of study through the core, mandatory and optional units to develop knowledge, skills and understanding that are relevant to the sector as a whole
 - Provide opportunities for the development of transferable and employability skills related to study and vocational application that provide a platform for success both within IT/computing and elsewhere
 - Give learners the potential opportunity to progress to employment or progress within employment in a wide range of job roles across the Information Technology sector and creative industries, for example in roles such as software engineer, website content manager, computer animator, helpdesk support, and graphic designer
 - Support progression into specialised level 3 vocational, general or apprenticeship qualifications in information technology, computing or creative media production.
